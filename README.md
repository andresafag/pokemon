# Pokesearch

This is a simple static website where the basic information about pokemons is found easyly.

> The mechanics behind this is mainly in the axi.js fie where a click event is triggered after clicking on the submit button.

In order to seek pokemon information I made use of a very useful API [pokemon api](https://pokeapi.co) which provided all the necessary information about pokemon species.

I made the requests using a promise-based HTTP Client for, in this case, the browser. It is an isomorphic module that can be running in browser/node.js side I highly recommend which prupose is to make requests and handle response in a very easy way [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).
